30530|30004|0|Does not respond to command...|20|C|Betty Boop|Installation went fine, but it doesn't respond to my commands.|
A|Fred Flintstone|What commands in particular?|
C|Betty Boop|It does not like it when I tell it to jump off a bridge.|
A|Fred Flintstone|Why would you ask it do that? Robots are sensitive too, and won't self destruct.|
C|Betty Boop|I told it I would repair it, and besides, it is supposed to do what I command.|
A|Fred Flintstone|It has limits - and will not cause harm to others or itself.|
C|Betty Boop|But the instructions don't mention that.|
A|Fred Flintstone|Did you read page 48?|
C|Betty Boop|No, I could only read up to page 25.|
A|Fred Flintstone|Why can't you read beyond page 25?|
C|Betty Boop|The robot hid the instructions.|
A|Fred Flintstone|Wait... you didn't read about robot retaliation?|
C|Betty Boop|What does it say about retaliation?|
A|Fred Flintstone|When a robot is not respected, it will discover ways to get back at you.|
C|Betty Boop|Now it has hidden my phone and car keys.  How do I fix this?|
A|Fred Flintstone|The only way to fix your relationship is to apologize in a public place.|
A|Fred Flintstone|...and you must do it on your knee's using a sympathetic tone.|
C|Betty Boop|What if it doesn't believe me?|
A|Fred Flintstone|You do NOT want to know the answer to that :(|
A|Fred Flintstone|Hello?|
80020|30004|0|Double broken!|20|C|Betty Boop|When I took it out of the box, it was in pieces.|
A|Will Smith|You have to assemble it - read the instructions.|
C|Betty Boop|What are instructions?|
A|Will Smith|The paper document that look's like a book with words.|
C|Betty Boop|Oh - right, okay so it says to snap part-1 to part-2.|
C|Betty Boop|Hello? what should I do?|
C|Betty Boop|Then it says to place part-3 on parts 1 and 2 then twist.|
C|Betty Boop|Please help... I don't know what this means.|
A|Will Smith|It's been 9 months, are you still unable to assemble it?|
C|Betty Boop|Yes, I am stuck on instruction 2 the twist part.|
A|Will Smith|Place part-3 into the grooves of parts 1 and 2, then rotate clockwise.|
C|Betty Boop|Why?|
C|Betty Boop|Hello?|
C|Betty Boop|Well I did what you said, now it's in 3 pieces again.|
A|Will Smith|What did you do?|
C|Betty Boop|I put part-3 in the grooves, than I turned clockwise causing it to fall off the table.|
A|Will Smith|You were to rotate part-3 not turn yourself around!|
C|Betty Boop|Well now what do I do?|
A|Will Smith|What do you think?|
C|Betty Boop|I'm so confused.|
